## First Thing — Read Project Context

// turbo-all

Before doing ANYTHING else:

1. Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in the project root to understand the project, environment status, and what was being worked on.
2. Continue from where the "Current Work In Progress" section left off.
3. Do NOT re-analyze the codebase unless the context file says to.
